<h1 style="color:darkred;"> <b> MY STORY</b></h1>
 

<h1>I'm a young entrepreneur, being the Founder & President of LateraLogics Innovations LLP, a technology solutions company that I founded at the age of 12 with a vision to come up with innovative solutions that can help make this world a better place.

I have a few awards & recognitions to my credit that include the National Child Award for Exceptional Achievements 2014 for Computer Technology (Govt. of India), Young Innovators Award 2017 from Dr. V. A. Shiva Ayyadurai Ph.D. - the inventor of e-mail, Google Web Rangers Award 2018, Google Code to Learn Contest 2014, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) App Inventor Bug Finding Contest 2014 (First Prize Winner), and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) App Inventor App Contest 2013 (First Prize Winner).

Being an active change-maker and an Ashoka ‘Youth Venturer’, I try my best to find time for volunteering activities geared towards social causes, and have served as Mentor & Advisor for Verizon's Technovation Challenges aimed at empowering girls with coding skills.

I'm also an avid blogger, keynote speaker, and an open-source contributor.

I was felicitated by the Computer Society of India (CSI) - Chennai, IEEE Computer Society - Madras, and IEEE Professional Communication Society - Madras at the CSI National Headquarters. I was also lucky enough to be felicitated by dignitaries such as late Shri Kalaignar Karunanidhi (former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu) and many other governmental & non-governmental organizations for my humble achievements at a young age.

I have been featured in a few regional, national and international magazines and TV programs (including India Today, The Hindu, Entrepreneur India, YourStory, Times of India, Economic Times, Tech Republic, ProgrammableWeb, Youth Incorporated Magazine, Entrepreneur India Magazine, Femina, NDTV, News 7 TV, All India Radio, Suryan FM, Puthiya Thalamurai, Malayala Manorama, Mathrubhumi, Vanitha, Deccan Chronicle, Zee TV, and the National Geographic Society's Magazine).

I remain grateful to have been mentioned in tweets from dignitaries that include Dr. Hal Abelson of MIT, Mr. Rajan Anandan, MD of Google India, and Pranav Mistry.</h1>
